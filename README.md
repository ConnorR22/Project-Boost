# Project-Boost
A Rocket Ship obstacle course with level progression

This game is a 2D dungeon crawler pulling inspiration from popular games like The binding of Isaac. 

The goal is to complete a series of dungeons through randomly selected levels, 
collecting gold and power ups to fight progressively harder levels. 

This project involves pixel shaders, level design with tilesets, dynamic camera following, player progression and inventory systems.

Features to add:
- Enemy AI
- Progressing difficulty
- Additional weapons/power
- NPC interaction
- Player level system
